Experimental:
-------------
For the atoms types considered, the fitting can be done from
    0 to ...
        07 as all potentials fall to 1e-3 before this
        12 as all potentials fall to 1e-4 before this
        20 as all potentials fall to 1e-5 before this

Miller:
-------
For the atoms types considered, the fitting can be done from
    0 to ...
        08 as all potentials fall to 1e-3 before this
        14 as all potentials fall to 1e-4 before this
        23 as all potentials fall to 1e-5 before this

M1:

        13 as all potentials fall to 1e-4 before this
        23 as all potentials fall to 1e-5 before this

M2:
---
For the atoms types considered, the fitting can be done from
    0 to ...
        08 as all potentials fall to 1e-3 before this
        13 as all potentials fall to 1e-4 before this
        23 as all potentials fall to 1e-5 before this

Let's use M2.
