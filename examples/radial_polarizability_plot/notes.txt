Static polarizabilites from https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00268976.2018.1535143

even though the Swann and Gribakin paper used values from https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00179a044

For the atoms considered through Ar, the fitting can be done from
    0 to ...
        20 as all potentials fall to 1e-3 before 20
        40 as all potentials fall to 1e-4 before 40
        60 as all potentials fall to 1e-5 before 60

Not sure which one of these is best.
