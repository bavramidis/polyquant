MO 2 electron integrals are correct

To check:
    frozen_core energy
        with 1 frozen MO
         E_fc = 2.0*h_mo (0,0) + eri_mo(0,0,0,0)
         this matches if exchange is disabled..
    problem is in the exchange and the E_fc evaluation. Maybe in how E_fc is added to the matrix elem

    for 1 fc orbital the 2body mo ints are right, the E_fc is right but the energy/slater condon elem is wrong
    this must be that E_fc is calculated differently than in the scf section
    E_fc seems to be calculated correct. Must be an error in slater condon elem
